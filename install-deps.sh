# first move Photo Booth folder out of Pictures
# then start Photo Booth. It'll ask where to put the library.
# put it in Dropbox/public

# now you can record photobooth videos quickly and they upload to dropbox DURING RECORDING
# then you grab public URL and send off your video message in a heartbeat.


# for the c alias (syntax highlighted cat)
sudo easy_install Pygments


# chrome canary as default
# on a mac you can set chrome canary as your default inside of Safari preferences :)
